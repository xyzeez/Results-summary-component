## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

In this project, I was able to practice gradient color pattern and also the use of ```hsla``` to reduce the color opacity.

### Continued development

This project entails the JSON file and I'd like to implement that with Javascript in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This helped me to generate the box shadow use on the ```main``` section.
